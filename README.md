# Game-of-Life-in-Robot-Karol
An Simulation of Conway's Game of Life in Robot Karol, an "programming language" used for educational purposes in Germany. It's based on Robot Karel. As Game of Life is turing-complete, this is proof that Robot Karol is too.
## Usage
Install Robot Karol from [here](https://www.schule.bayern.de/karol "here").
Open the .kdp- and one of the example .kdw-files and click run.
If you want to build your own start-states the startposition of the Robot needs to be the same. If you need more than 8x8 spaces you need to adjust the Code and you need to leave a row on each side blank.
